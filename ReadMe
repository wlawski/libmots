libmots
-------

libmots library allows you to display additional debug information on
the screen. It is very useful when you cannot keep active adb
connection, e.g. while debugging application that changes USB states. libmots
library has an advantage over toasts - history is available. This can be very
useful for longer scenarios. You can start logging at any time you want and
clear already collected messages.

You can find screenshots presenting use of 'Hello libmots' application
inside this directory: tests/monkeyrunner-tests/reference-screenshots

USAGE
-----

To start, you need to add libmots library to your project and add this
line to your main project.properties file:

	manifestmerger.enabled=true

This is simplest part you need to add to your source code:

	...
	import net.wiktorlawski.messageonthescreen.MessageOnTheScreen;
	...
	MessageOnTheScreen mots =
		MessageOnTheScreen.getInstance(activity, false);
	mots.setText(activity, "Hello libmots!");

SAMPLES & TESTS
---------------

Library comes with both sample application (samples/ directory) and tests
(tests/ directory). monkeyrunner tests use emulator which you can prepare
running this command:

	android create avd -n android-1.6 -t android-4

(without creation of custom hardware profile).

To run monkeyrunner tests, just start run-tests.bat from
tests/monkeyrunner-tests directory.
